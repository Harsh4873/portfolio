# Portfolio Maintenance

This repository is for Harsh Dave's Portfolio app only.

## Product Boundary

- The Portfolio app lives in the standalone `Harsh4873/portfolio` repository and publishes under `/portfolio/`.
- Do not add or modify PickLedger, betting, prediction, scraper, grading, model-cache, or player-prop code from this branch.
- Do not add or modify Gym source, workout data, storage, or styling from this branch.
- Do not reuse PickLedger's sports-dashboard styling or Gym's utility-app styling. Portfolio uses its own editorial atlas system.
- Keep factual Portfolio copy centralized in `src/content.ts`; omit claims that are ambiguous, private, or not supported by the resume workspace.
- The `main` branch publishes Portfolio through this repository's Pages workflow.

## Verification

- Never open the deployed site, a browser preview, rendered Pages output, or live URLs to verify Portfolio. The user confirms production behavior.
- Agents may review source, run typecheck/build, inspect generated file paths as text, and inspect GitHub Actions/API state.
- Before publishing Portfolio work, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.

## GitHub Publish

- Commit Portfolio work on the `main` branch and push `main`.
- Commits and pushes must come from the currently logged-in GitHub user.
- Never add AI co-author trailers, `Co-authored-by:` lines, or AI/Cursor/Codex taglines.
- Do not overwrite or revert unrelated user changes.
